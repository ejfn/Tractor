### **Priority Levels**

**Priority 0: Historical Insights** - Adaptive counter-strategies based on opponent behavioral patterns (activates after 3+ tricks)

**Priority 1: Team Coordination** - Support teammate when winning or set up strategic plays

**Priority 2: Opponent Blocking** - Block opponent point collection with strategic card management

**Priority 3: Trick Contention** - Contest valuable tricks (≥5 points) when winnable

**Priority 4: Strategic Disposal** - Play weakest cards while preserving valuable combinations

## Scoring-Based Leading Strategy

The AI implements a **unified scoring-based leading strategy** that evaluates all possible candidate leads and selects the highest scoring option. This replaces the previous complex priority chain system with a transparent, maintainable scoring approach.

### **Core Architecture**

#### **4-Module System**

1. **Candidate Detection (`candidateLeadDetection.ts`)**: Finds ALL possible leads
   - **Multi-combo detection**: Unbeatable multi-combos from each non-trump suit
   - **Straight combo detection**: All tractors, pairs, and singles from hand
   - **Unbeatable analysis**: Memory-enhanced detection of guaranteed winners
   - **Deduplication**: Prevents overlap between multi-combo and straight combos

2. **Context Collection (`leadingContext.ts`)**: Gathers strategic information
   - **Void status analysis**: Checks if all other players are void in each suit
   - **Team information**: Current attacking/defending team status
   - **Point pressure**: Calculated based on current team progress
   - **Game phase**: Early, mid, or endgame strategic context

3. **Scoring Evaluation (`leadingScoring.ts`)**: Comprehensive candidate scoring
   - **Base card values**: Uses actual card rank values (Ace=14, King=13, etc.)
   - **Pair bonuses**: +20 for non-trump pairs, +30 for trump pairs
   - **Unbeatable bonus**: +50 for guaranteed winners
   - **Trump penalties**: -rankValue per trump card to encourage conservation
   - **Void suit bonuses**: +10 for weak combos in void suits (strategic opportunities)

4. **Selection & Execution (`leadingStrategy.ts`)**: Chooses best option
   - **Score ranking**: Sorts all candidates by total score
   - **Tie breaking**: Uses card strength for equal scores
   - **Fallback handling**: Graceful degradation when no candidates found
   - **Comprehensive logging**: Detailed reasoning for analysis

### **Scoring Algorithm**

#### **Base Scoring Components**

```typescript
// 1. Card rank values (base score)
const baseScore = candidate.cards.reduce((sum, card) => sum + getCardRankValue(card), 0);

// 2. Pair bonuses
const pairBonus = candidate.metadata.totalPairs * (candidate.metadata.isTrump ? 30 : 20);

// 3. Unbeatable bonus
const unbeatableBonus = candidate.metadata.isUnbeatable ? 50 : 0;

// 4. Trump penalties (conservation)
const trumpPenalty = candidate.metadata.isTrump ? 
  -candidate.cards.reduce((sum, card) => sum + getTrumpPenalty(card), 0) : 0;

// 5. Void suit bonus (strategic opportunities)
const voidBonus = (isVoidSuit && isWeakCombo) ? 10 : 0;

const totalScore = baseScore + pairBonus + unbeatableBonus + trumpPenalty + voidBonus;
```

#### **Strategic Priorities**

1. **Unbeatable leads** (score +50): Guaranteed winners receive highest priority
2. **High-value pairs** (score +20/+30): Pairs get significant bonuses over singles
3. **Card strength** (score +2 to +14): Higher ranked cards preferred
4. **Trump conservation** (negative scores): Trump cards penalized to encourage saving
5. **Void exploitation** (score +10): Weak combos in void suits get bonus

### **Decision Process**

1. **Comprehensive Detection**: Find every possible lead candidate
2. **Context Analysis**: Gather void status and team information
3. **Score Calculation**: Evaluate each candidate with detailed reasoning
4. **Best Selection**: Choose highest scoring option with tie-breaking
5. **Execution**: Play selected cards with comprehensive logging

### **Benefits Over Priority Chain**

- **Transparency**: Clear scoring makes decisions easy to understand and debug
- **Maintainability**: Simple to adjust individual scoring components
- **Consistency**: All leads evaluated by same criteria, no special cases
- **Flexibility**: Easy to add new scoring factors or adjust existing ones
- **Performance**: Single pass evaluation faster than multiple priority checks

## Historical Intelligence

The AI analyzes opponent behavior patterns and adapts its strategy accordingly:

### **Opponent Modeling**

**Behavioral Analysis:**
- **Aggressiveness Patterns** - Trump lead frequency and risk-taking behavior
- **Point Card Management** - How opponents handle valuable cards
- **Team Coordination Style** - Supportive vs independent play patterns
- **Suit Preferences** - Strong suits and leading tendencies

**Adaptive Counter-Strategies:**
- **Against Aggressive Opponents** - Conservative blocking and trump conservation
- **Against Conservative Opponents** - Aggressive point collection and tactical pressure
- **Against Adaptive Opponents** - Variable strategies and unpredictable play patterns

---

## Position-Based Intelligence

The AI adapts its strategy based on trick position, leveraging unique advantages of each playing order:

### **Leading Player Strategy**

**Strategic Capabilities:**
- **Memory-Enhanced Leading** - Guaranteed winner identification for optimal timing
- **Game Phase Adaptation** - Early probing vs mid-game aggression vs endgame control
- **Information Management** - Balance between learning and hand concealment
- **Point Collection Priority** - Aces and Kings before tractors when guaranteed

#### **Weak Multi-Combo Leading**

The AI uses a context-aware approach to leading weak multi-combos (e.g., two or three small, non-point singles). This prevents the AI from making risky, low-value leads in critical game situations.

**Decision Logic:**
- **Attacking Team**: The AI will lead a weak multi-combo to probe for opponent responses and gain information.
- **Defending Team**: The AI will only lead a weak multi-combo when the `pointPressure` is `LOW`. This ensures the defending team plays conservatively and avoids giving up the lead unnecessarily when the attacking team is close to winning.

### **Following Player Strategy**

All following positions use the same priority framework but with position-specific tactical advantages:

**Position-Specific Advantages:**

**2nd Player (Early Follower):**
- **Partial Information** - Can influence remaining 2 players
- **Setup Opportunities** - Position teammates for optimal responses
- **Early Blocking** - Prevent opponent momentum

**3rd Player (Enhanced Takeover Logic):**
- **Strategic Value Analysis** - Uses `calculateCardStrategicValue()` for lead strength assessment
- **Trump Weakness Detection** - Recognizes that leading trump often indicates strategic weakness
- **Intelligent Takeover Decisions** - Dynamic takeover vs support based on teammate lead strength
- **Risk Assessment** - Comprehensive analysis with memory-enhanced decision making

#### **Enhanced 3rd Player Takeover System**

The AI now uses sophisticated strategic value analysis to determine when to take over from a teammate:

**Strategic Value Thresholds:**
- **Strong** (≥170): Jokers, trump rank cards → Support teammate
- **Moderate** (110-169): High trump suit cards (J, Q, K, A) → Strategic evaluation  
- **Weak** (<110): Low trump cards ≤ 10, forced plays → Consider takeover

**Key Enhancement - Trump Analysis:**
```typescript
// Trump analysis based on strategic value
if (strategicValue >= 170) {
  leadStrength = "strong"; // Jokers, trump rank cards
} else if (strategicValue > 110) {
  leadStrength = "moderate"; // Trump suit cards > 10 (J, Q, K, A)
} else {
  leadStrength = "weak"; // Trump suit cards ≤ 10 (forced play)
  vulnerabilityFactors.push("low_trump_forced_play");
}
```

**Non-Trump Analysis:** Uses `isBiggestInSuit()` utility to identify theoretical card strength:
- **Strong**: Ace when Ace is not trump rank, King when Ace is trump rank
- **Moderate**: Queen, Jack (strategic value ~12, 11)  
- **Weak**: 10 and below → potential takeover scenario

**Takeover Decision Logic:**
- **Weak + Vulnerable**: Immediate takeover recommendation
- **Moderate**: Strategic evaluation based on risk assessment
- **Strong**: Support teammate with point contribution

**4th Player (Perfect Information):**
- **Complete Visibility** - All 3 cards played before decision
- **Optimal Decisions** - Perfect information for point maximization
- **Strategic Precision** - Minimal waste, maximum effectiveness

---

## Advanced Strategic Capabilities

### **Trump Management**

The AI uses sophisticated trump conservation with hierarchical values:

**Conservation Hierarchy:**
```
Big Joker (100) > Small Joker (90) > Trump Rank in Trump Suit (80) > 
Trump Rank in Off-Suits (70) > Trump Suit Cards (A♠:60 → 3♠:5)
```

**Strategic Principles:**
- **Hierarchical Preservation** - Play weakest trump when forced (3♠, 4♠)
- **Valuable Trump Protection** - Preserve trump rank cards and jokers
- **Memory-Enhanced Usage** - Track opponent trump depletion for optimal timing
- **Strategic Deployment** - Use trump exhaustion analysis for perfect timing

### **Kitty Swap Strategy**

The AI employs a **streamlined rule-based approach** with clear exclusion principles and intelligent suit elimination when managing the 8-card kitty.

**Core Exclusion Rules (Never Dispose):**
- **No Trump Cards** - All trump cards preserved for strategic advantage
- **No Biggest Cards** - Aces and Kings always protected regardless of suit
- **No Tractors** - Consecutive pairs preserved for powerful combinations
- **No Big Pairs** - Pairs with rank > 7 preserved for strategic value

**Unified Strategy Framework:**

The AI uses a single, clean approach that handles both normal and strong hand scenarios:

1. **Apply Basic Exclusions** - Categorize all cards into disposable vs excluded
2. **Sufficient Disposables (≥8 cards)**: Use intelligent suit elimination strategy
3. **Insufficient Disposables (<8 cards)**: Use ALL disposables + value-sorted exclusions

**Intelligent Suit Elimination (≥8 Disposables):**
- **Trump Strength Evaluation**: Normal (≤9), Strong (10-14), Very Strong (15+)
- **Suit Elimination Scoring**:
  - **Prefer Shorter Suits** - 2-6 card suits prioritized for elimination
  - **Penalize Point Cards** - 10s and 5s avoided (penalty reduced with stronger trump)
  - **Penalize Kings** - Even disposable Kings avoided when possible
  - **Bonus Non-Point Suits** - Ideal elimination targets for strategic voids

**Simple Value Selection (<8 Disposables):**
- **Use ALL disposable cards first** - Every non-valuable card included
- **Fill remainder from exclusions** - Simple strategic value sorting for remaining slots
- **Automatic Trump Hierarchy** - Conservation values ensure optimal trump disposal order

**Conservation Hierarchy for Trump Disposal:**
When forced to dispose trump cards, the AI follows strict conservation values:
- **Weakest Trump First**: 3♠ (5) → 4♠ (10) → 5♠ (15) → ... → K♠ (55) → A♠ (60)
- **Trump Rank Priority**: Off-suit trump rank (70) vs trump suit trump rank (80)
- **Joker Protection**: Big Joker (100) and Small Joker (90) never disposed

**Strategic Advantages:**
- **Single Function Design** - One streamlined function eliminates duplicate logic
- **Predictable Logic** - Clear, maintainable rules that avoid edge cases
- **Value Preservation** - Systematic exclusion ensures optimal card selection
- **Clean Codebase** - Simplified architecture with no redundant validation
- **Conservation Hierarchy** - Optimal trump disposal when forced by exceptional hand scenarios
- **Bug Prevention** - Rule-based approach eliminates previous issues with valuable card disposal

### **Shared Utility Functions**

The AI system uses several shared utility functions for consistent strategic analysis:

**`isBiggestInSuit(card, trumpInfo)`** - Determines theoretical card strength:
- Returns `true` for Ace when Ace is not trump rank
- Returns `true` for King when Ace is trump rank (making King strongest)
- Used across multiple AI modules for consistent strength evaluation
- Critical for 3rd player takeover analysis and lead strength assessment

**`calculateCardStrategicValue(card, trumpInfo, mode)`** - Core strategic evaluation:
- Provides numerical values for strategic decision-making
- Supports multiple modes: "basic", "strategic", "contribute"
- Used throughout the AI system for consistent card evaluation
- Forms the foundation of the enhanced 3rd player takeover logic

### **Trump Declaration Strategy**

During progressive dealing, the AI uses sophisticated declaration logic:

**Strategic Capabilities:**
- **Hand Quality Focus** - Prioritizes suit length over high cards (7+ cards recommended)
- **Timing Optimization** - Peak declaration window at 40-70% of dealing
- **Override Intelligence** - Strategic decisions on when to override opponents
- **Team Coordination** - Consider teammate implications and positioning

---

## Strategic Disposal Hierarchy

When the AI cannot win a trick, it follows a sophisticated disposal system:

**Disposal Categories:**
- **Safe Cards** - No trump, no Ace, no points (7♣, 8♠, 9♦)
- **Good Cards** - Lose an Ace but no points given (A♣, Q♠, J♦)
- **Acceptable Cards** - Give away points but save trump (5♣, 10♠, K♦)
- **Forced Cards** - Trump cards only when no choice (3♦, 4♦)
