## Restructured AI Priority Chain

The AI strategy has been completely restructured into a clean 4-priority decision chain that eliminates conflicts and ensures sophisticated yet predictable decision-making.

### Priority Chain Architecture

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Start([FOLLOW PLAY DECISION]) --> TrickWinner[Real-time Trick Winner Analysis<br/>analyzeTrickWinner<br/>Identify current winner<br/>Calculate trick points<br/>Assess beating capability]
    
    TrickWinner --> P1{Priority 1:<br/>TEAM COORDINATION}
    P1 -->|Teammate Winning| TeamCoord[Team Coordination Logic<br/>Contribute point cards if human leads Ace<br/>Play conservatively if teammate strong<br/>Support team point collection]
    
    P1 -->|Not Teammate| P2{Priority 2:<br/>OPPONENT BLOCKING}
    P2 -->|Opponent Winning| OpponentBlock[Opponent Blocking Logic<br/>High-value tricks: Always beat<br/>Moderate tricks: Beat if reasonable<br/>Low-value tricks: Conserve cards]
    
    P2 -->|Not Opponent| P3{Priority 3:<br/>TRICK CONTENTION}
    P3 -->|Can Win + Worth It| TrickContest[Trick Contention Logic<br/>Only contest tricks with 5+ points<br/>Use optimal winning combinations<br/>Maximize strategic value]
    
    P3 -->|Not Worth It| P4[Priority 4:<br/>STRATEGIC DISPOSAL]
    P4 --> Disposal[Strategic Disposal Logic<br/>Conserve Aces when cannot win<br/>Play weakest available cards<br/>Preserve high cards for future]
    
    TeamCoord --> Return[Return Selected Cards]
    OpponentBlock --> Return
    TrickContest --> Return
    Disposal --> Return
```

### Priority 1: Team Coordination

**Triggers when**: `trickWinner?.isTeammateWinning === true`

**Key Behaviors**:
- **Human Leads Ace**: AI teammates contribute point cards with hierarchy (10 > King > 5)
- **Teammate Winning Strong**: Play conservatively to preserve team resources
- **Point Collection Support**: Coordinate with teammate for optimal point gathering

**Implementation**: `handleTeammateWinning()` in `aiStrategy.ts`

### Priority 2: Opponent Blocking

**Triggers when**: `trickWinner?.isOpponentWinning === true`

**Strategic Thresholds**:
- **High-Value (≥10 points)**: Always attempt to beat opponent if possible
- **Moderate (5-9 points)**: Beat if strategically reasonable
- **Low-Value (0-4 points)**: Conserve high cards, don't waste resources

**Implementation**: `handleOpponentWinning()` in `aiStrategy.ts`

### Priority 3: Trick Contention

**Triggers when**: `trickAnalysis.canWin && trickAnalysis.shouldContest`

**Contest Logic**:
- Only contests tricks worth ≥5 points (`shouldContest = currentTrick?.points >= 5`)
- Uses `selectOptimalWinningCombo()` to choose most effective winning play
- Balances immediate gains with long-term strategy

**Implementation**: `selectOptimalWinningCombo()` in `aiStrategy.ts`

### Priority 4: Strategic Disposal

**Triggers when**: All higher priorities fail to return a move

**Disposal Strategy**:
- Prefers non-Aces when trick can't be won
- Plays weakest available combinations
- Preserves high-value cards for future strategic opportunities

**Implementation**: `selectStrategicDisposal()` in `aiStrategy.ts`

### Benefits of Restructured System

1. **Eliminates Conflicts**: Clear priority order prevents logic contradictions
2. **Predictable Behavior**: Consistent decision-making across all scenarios  
3. **Enhanced Ace Conservation**: Smart preservation of high-value cards
4. **Opponent Blocking**: Sophisticated response to opponent point collection
5. **Team Coordination**: Improved cooperation with human teammates

### Real-time Trick Winner Analysis

The restructured system leverages real-time `winningPlayerId` tracking for immediate strategic decisions:

```typescript
// Real-time analysis replaces expensive computations
const trickWinner = context.trickWinnerAnalysis;
if (trickWinner?.isOpponentWinning && trickWinner.trickPoints >= 10) {
  // Immediate aggressive response to high-value opponent threats
  return selectOptimalWinningCombo(/* optimal beating strategy */);
}
```

This approach provides:
- **Performance**: Direct property access vs complex calculations
- **Accuracy**: Real-time game state reflection
- **Responsiveness**: Immediate strategic adaptation

## Phase 1: Foundation Intelligence

### Core Capabilities

- **Combination Detection**: Identifies singles, pairs, and tractors from hand
- **Trump Management**: Understands trump hierarchy and strength
- **Basic Strategy**: Follows suit requirements and plays valid combinations
- **Rule Compliance**: Ensures all moves follow game rules

### Technical Implementation

- Uses `createGameContext()` for basic game state analysis
- Implements simple heuristics for card selection
- Focuses on legal moves and basic game flow

## Phase 2: Strategic Context (Implemented)

### Enhanced Features

- **Point-Focused Strategy**: Prioritizes high-value cards (5s, 10s, Kings)
- **Positional Awareness**: Adapts strategy based on trick position
- **Team Dynamics**: Understands attacking vs defending team roles
- **Pressure Response**: Adjusts aggression based on point requirements
- **Real-time Trick Winner Analysis**: Uses `winningPlayerId` to make sophisticated decisions about conservative vs aggressive play

### Strategic Algorithms

#### Point Pressure System

```typescript
enum PointPressure {
  LOW = 'low',      // < 40% of points needed
  MEDIUM = 'medium', // 40-70% of points needed  
  HIGH = 'high'     // > 70% of points needed
}
```

#### Positional Strategy

- **Leading (First)**: Plays strong combinations to control trick
- **Following**: Balances point collection with combination matching
- **Late Position**: Focuses on point maximization or blocking

#### Play Style Adaptation

```typescript
enum PlayStyle {
  Conservative = 'conservative', // Preserve high cards
  Balanced = 'balanced',        // Mix of offense/defense
  Aggressive = 'aggressive',    // Force points aggressively
  Desperate = 'desperate'       // All-out point grabbing
}
```

### Implementation Details

- **Context Creation**: `src/ai/aiGameContext.ts` analyzes current game state using real-time trick winner tracking
- **Real-Time Tracking**: Uses `trick.winningPlayerId` for immediate winner identification without calculations
- **RESTRUCTURED Priority Chain**: `selectOptimalFollowPlay()` implements clean 4-priority decision system
- **Strategy Selection**: `src/ai/aiPointFocusedStrategy.ts` provides specialized strategy functions  
- **Combo Analysis**: `src/ai/aiAdvancedCombinations.ts` evaluates combination strength
- **Decision Engine**: `src/ai/aiStrategy.ts` implements all strategic components with restructured flow

#### Restructured AI Priority Chain

```typescript
// PRIORITY 1: TEAM COORDINATION
if (trickWinner?.isTeammateWinning) {
  return this.handleTeammateWinning(comboAnalyses, context, trumpInfo);
}

// PRIORITY 2: OPPONENT BLOCKING  
if (trickWinner?.isOpponentWinning) {
  const response = this.handleOpponentWinning(...);
  if (response) return response;
}

// PRIORITY 3: TRICK CONTENTION
if (trickAnalysis.canWin && trickAnalysis.shouldContest) {
  return this.selectOptimalWinningCombo(...);
}

// PRIORITY 4: STRATEGIC DISPOSAL
return this.selectStrategicDisposal(...);
```

The restructured system provides:

- **Clear Priority Order**: No conflicting or overlapping logic paths
