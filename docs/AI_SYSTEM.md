### **Priority Levels**

**Priority 0: Historical Insights** - Adaptive counter-strategies based on opponent behavioral patterns (activates after 3+ tricks)

**Priority 1: Team Coordination** - Support teammate when winning or set up strategic plays

**Priority 2: Opponent Blocking** - Block opponent point collection with strategic card management

**Priority 3: Trick Contention** - Contest valuable tricks (‚â•5 points) when winnable

**Priority 4: Strategic Disposal** - Play weakest cards while preserving valuable combinations

## Memory-Enhanced Strategy

The AI implements a **comprehensive memory system** that tracks cards, analyzes patterns, and enables sophisticated strategic decision-making based on accumulated game knowledge.

### **Core Memory Components**

#### Card Memory Tracking (`aiCardMemory.ts`)

- **Played Card Tracking**: Complete record of all cards played throughout the game
- **Hand Size Estimation**: Dynamic tracking of estimated cards remaining per player
- **Suit Void Detection**: Automatic detection when players can no longer follow suit
- **Trump Exhaustion Analysis**: Tracking trump depletion levels for all players

#### Advanced Analysis Modules

- **Point Timing (`pointCardTiming.ts`)**: Memory-enhanced point collection optimization

### **Guaranteed Winner Detection**

The AI identifies cards that are certain to win based on comprehensive memory analysis:

#### Detection Logic

- **Singles Logic**: K‚ô• wins if both A‚ô• copies have been played
- **Pairs Logic**: Q‚ô•-Q‚ô• wins if ANY A‚ô• or K‚ô• has been played
- **Trump Logic**: Accounts for trump hierarchy and remaining trump cards
- **Cross-Suit Analysis**: Considers void patterns for guaranteed trick wins

#### Strategic Applications

- **Point Collection Priority** - Play guaranteed point winners before opponents run out of suit
- **Optimal Sequencing** - Order plays based on remaining card knowledge and certainty
- **Risk Minimization** - Use certain winners to secure valuable tricks with minimal waste
- **Endgame Precision** - Leverage perfect information in final tricks for maximum points

### **Advanced Void Exploitation**

#### Smart Void Analysis

- **Confirmed Voids**: Definitively identified when players trump or discard
- **Probable Voids**: Statistical analysis based on play patterns and card distribution
- **Teammate vs Opponent Strategy**: Different exploitation approaches based on team relationships

#### Teammate Void Strategy (Smart Point Collection)

```typescript
// NEW: Smart teammate void analysis
if (opponentPoints >= 15 && teammateCanTrump) {
  strategy = "lead_for_points"  // üéØ Lead to collect points for team
} else {
  strategy = "avoid_leading"    // üõ°Ô∏è Protect teammate from forced trump
}
```

#### Opponent Void Strategy (Aggressive Exploitation)

- **Force Trump Waste**: Lead void suits to exhaust opponent trump cards
- **Strategic Isolation**: Use void knowledge for optimal trick timing
- **Multi-Suit Patterns**: Exploit complex void combinations

### **Trump Exhaustion & Conservation**

#### Dynamic Trump Analysis

- **Exhaustion Tracking**: Monitor trump depletion across all players
- **Conservation Values**: Dynamic hierarchy based on remaining trump distribution
- **Timing Optimization**: Optimal trump usage based on exhaustion analysis

#### Conservation Hierarchy

```text
Big Joker (100) > Small Joker (90) > Trump Rank in Trump Suit (80) > 
Trump Rank in Off-Suits (70) > Trump Suit Cards (A‚ô†:60 ‚Üí 3‚ô†:5)
```

**Position-Specific Advantages:**

**2nd Player (Early Follower):**
- **Partial Information** - Can influence remaining 2 players
- **Setup Opportunities** - Position teammates for optimal responses
- **Early Blocking** - Prevent opponent momentum

**3rd Player (Tactical Position):**
- **Enhanced Team Coordination** - Critical teammate support decisions
- **Tactical Takeover** - Override teammate when beneficial

- **Optimal Decisions** - Perfect information for point maximization
- **Strategic Precision** - Minimal waste, maximum effectiveness

---

## Advanced Strategic Capabilities

### **Trump Management**

The AI uses sophisticated trump conservation with hierarchical values:

**Conservation Hierarchy:**
```
Big Joker (100) > Small Joker (90) > Trump Rank in Trump Suit (80) > 
Trump Rank in Off-Suits (70) > Trump Suit Cards (A‚ô†:60 ‚Üí 3‚ô†:5)
```

**Strategic Principles:**
- **Hierarchical Preservation** - Play weakest trump when forced (3‚ô†, 4‚ô†)
- **Valuable Trump Protection** - Preserve trump rank cards and jokers
- **Memory-Enhanced Usage** - Track opponent trump depletion for optimal timing
- **Strategic Deployment** - Use trump exhaustion analysis for perfect timing

### **Kitty Swap Strategy**

The AI employs a **streamlined rule-based approach** with clear exclusion principles and intelligent suit elimination when managing the 8-card kitty.

**Core Exclusion Rules (Never Dispose):**
- **No Trump Cards** - All trump cards preserved for strategic advantage
- **No Biggest Cards** - Aces and Kings always protected regardless of suit
- **No Tractors** - Consecutive pairs preserved for powerful combinations
- **No Big Pairs** - Pairs with rank > 7 preserved for strategic value

**Unified Strategy Framework:**

The AI uses a single, clean approach that handles both normal and strong hand scenarios:

1. **Apply Basic Exclusions** - Categorize all cards into disposable vs excluded
2. **Sufficient Disposables (‚â•8 cards)**: Use intelligent suit elimination strategy
3. **Insufficient Disposables (<8 cards)**: Use ALL disposables + value-sorted exclusions

**Intelligent Suit Elimination (‚â•8 Disposables):**
- **Trump Strength Evaluation**: Normal (‚â§9), Strong (10-14), Very Strong (15+)
- **Suit Elimination Scoring**:
  - **Prefer Shorter Suits** - 2-6 card suits prioritized for elimination
  - **Penalize Point Cards** - 10s and 5s avoided (penalty reduced with stronger trump)
  - **Penalize Kings** - Even disposable Kings avoided when possible
  - **Bonus Non-Point Suits** - Ideal elimination targets for strategic voids

**Simple Value Selection (<8 Disposables):**
- **Use ALL disposable cards first** - Every non-valuable card included
- **Fill remainder from exclusions** - Simple strategic value sorting for remaining slots
- **Automatic Trump Hierarchy** - Conservation values ensure optimal trump disposal order

**Conservation Hierarchy for Trump Disposal:**
When forced to dispose trump cards, the AI follows strict conservation values:
- **Weakest Trump First**: 3‚ô† (5) ‚Üí 4‚ô† (10) ‚Üí 5‚ô† (15) ‚Üí ... ‚Üí K‚ô† (55) ‚Üí A‚ô† (60)
- **Trump Rank Priority**: Off-suit trump rank (70) vs trump suit trump rank (80)
- **Joker Protection**: Big Joker (100) and Small Joker (90) never disposed

**Strategic Advantages:**
- **Single Function Design** - One streamlined function eliminates duplicate logic
- **Predictable Logic** - Clear, maintainable rules that avoid edge cases
- **Value Preservation** - Systematic exclusion ensures optimal card selection
- **Clean Codebase** - Simplified architecture with no redundant validation
- **Conservation Hierarchy** - Optimal trump disposal when forced by exceptional hand scenarios
- **Bug Prevention** - Rule-based approach eliminates previous issues with valuable card disposal

### **Trump Declaration Strategy**

During progressive dealing, the AI uses sophisticated declaration logic:

**Strategic Capabilities:**
- **Hand Quality Focus** - Prioritizes suit length over high cards (7+ cards recommended)
- **Timing Optimization** - Peak declaration window at 40-70% of dealing
- **Override Intelligence** - Strategic decisions on when to override opponents
- **Team Coordination** - Consider teammate implications and positioning

---

## Strategic Disposal Hierarchy

When the AI cannot win a trick, it follows a sophisticated disposal system:

**Disposal Categories:**
- **Safe Cards** - No trump, no Ace, no points (7‚ô£, 8‚ô†, 9‚ô¶)
- **Good Cards** - Lose an Ace but no points given (A‚ô£, Q‚ô†, J‚ô¶)
- **Acceptable Cards** - Give away points but save trump (5‚ô£, 10‚ô†, K‚ô¶)
- **Forced Cards** - Trump cards only when no choice (3‚ô¶, 4‚ô¶)
