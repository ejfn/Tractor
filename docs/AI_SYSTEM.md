## Decision Framework

The AI follows a **5-level decision framework** that ensures consistent strategic behavior across all game situations:

```

### **Priority Levels**

**Priority 0: Historical Insights** - Adaptive counter-strategies based on opponent behavioral patterns (activates after 3+ tricks)

**Priority 1: Team Coordination** - Support teammate when winning or set up strategic plays

**Priority 2: Opponent Blocking** - Block opponent point collection with strategic card management

**Priority 3: Trick Contention** - Contest valuable tricks (≥5 points) when winnable

**Priority 4: Strategic Disposal** - Play weakest cards while preserving valuable combinations

## Memory-Enhanced Strategy

The AI uses sophisticated card tracking and probability analysis to make optimal decisions:

### **Guaranteed Winner Detection**

The AI identifies cards that are certain to win based on memory:

- **Singles Logic**: K♥ wins if both A♥ copies have been played
- **Pairs Logic**: Q♥-Q♥ wins if ANY A♥ or K♥ has been played

**Strategic Benefits:**
- **Point Collection Priority** - Play guaranteed point winners before opponents run out of suit
- **Optimal Timing** - Sequence plays based on remaining card knowledge
- **Risk Minimization** - Use certain winners to secure valuable tricks

## Historical Intelligence

The AI analyzes opponent behavior patterns and adapts its strategy accordingly:

### **Opponent Modeling**

**Behavioral Analysis:**
- **Aggressiveness Patterns** - Trump lead frequency and risk-taking behavior
- **Point Card Management** - How opponents handle valuable cards
- **Team Coordination Style** - Supportive vs independent play patterns
- **Suit Preferences** - Strong suits and leading tendencies

**Adaptive Counter-Strategies:**
- **Against Aggressive Opponents** - Conservative blocking and trump conservation
- **Against Conservative Opponents** - Aggressive point collection and tactical pressure
- **Against Adaptive Opponents** - Variable strategies and unpredictable play patterns

---

## Position-Based Intelligence

The AI adapts its strategy based on trick position, leveraging unique advantages of each playing order:

### **Leading Player Strategy**

**Strategic Capabilities:**
- **Memory-Enhanced Leading** - Guaranteed winner identification for optimal timing
- **Game Phase Adaptation** - Early probing vs mid-game aggression vs endgame control
- **Information Management** - Balance between learning and hand concealment
- **Point Collection Priority** - Aces and Kings before tractors when guaranteed

### **Following Player Strategy**

All following positions use the same priority framework but with position-specific tactical advantages:

**Position-Specific Advantages:**

**2nd Player (Early Follower):**
- **Partial Information** - Can influence remaining 2 players
- **Setup Opportunities** - Position teammates for optimal responses
- **Early Blocking** - Prevent opponent momentum

**3rd Player (Tactical Position):**
- **Enhanced Team Coordination** - Critical teammate support decisions
- **Tactical Takeover** - Override teammate when beneficial
- **Risk Assessment** - Informed decisions with 2 cards visible

**4th Player (Perfect Information):**
- **Complete Visibility** - All 3 cards played before decision
- **Optimal Decisions** - Perfect information for point maximization
- **Strategic Precision** - Minimal waste, maximum effectiveness

---

## Advanced Strategic Capabilities

### **Trump Management**

The AI uses sophisticated trump conservation with hierarchical values:

**Conservation Hierarchy:**
```
Big Joker (100) > Small Joker (90) > Trump Rank in Trump Suit (80) > 
Trump Rank in Off-Suits (70) > Trump Suit Cards (A♠:60 → 3♠:5)
```

**Strategic Principles:**
- **Hierarchical Preservation** - Play weakest trump when forced (3♠, 4♠)
- **Valuable Trump Protection** - Preserve trump rank cards and jokers
- **Memory-Enhanced Usage** - Track opponent trump depletion for optimal timing
- **Strategic Deployment** - Use trump exhaustion analysis for perfect timing

### **Kitty Swap Strategy**

The AI employs **trump-strength-aware suit elimination** with hierarchical conservation analysis when managing the 8-card kitty.

**Enhanced Strategic Framework:**

**Trump Hierarchy Integration:**
- **Conservation Value Calculation** - Each trump card scored by hierarchy (BJ:100 → 3♠:5)
- **Never Eliminate Critical Combos** - Suits with Critical/Strong ComboStrength preserved
- **Trump vs Non-Trump Priorities** - Trump suits penalized by conservation value, not flat rates
- **Hierarchical Trump Disposal** - When forced, dispose weakest trump suit cards (3♠, 4♠) over valuable trump rank cards

**Trump-Only Disposal Logic:**
When forced to dispose trump cards (insufficient non-trump options), the AI uses pure conservation hierarchy:
- **Primary Rule**: Always select weakest trump cards first regardless of pair preservation
- **Conservation Ranking**: 3♠ (5) < 4♠ (10) < 5♠ (15) < ... < K♠ (55) < A♠ (60) < 2♥ (70) < 2♠ (80)
- **Implementation**: Direct conservation value sorting replaces pair-preserving logic for trump-only scenarios
- **Result**: Consistently selects optimal trump disposal (e.g., 8×3♠ instead of 6×3♠ + K♠ + A♠)

**ComboStrength-Based Analysis:**
- **Critical Strength** - High-value trump (≥80 conservation), never disposed
- **Strong Strength** - Mid-value trump (≥40 conservation), Aces, Kings
- **Medium Strength** - Point cards (5s, 10s, Kings in non-trump)
- **Weak Strength** - Low non-point cards, disposal priority

**Strategic Decision Modes:**

**SUIT_ELIMINATION Mode:**
- **Target**: 1-2 weak suits with no Critical/Strong combos
- **Requirements**: Elimination score > preservation score, no tractors, low trump conservation value
- **Benefit**: Creates strategic voids for advanced play
- **Protection**: Filters out Aces, Kings, and point cards during suit elimination fallback

**CONSERVATIVE Mode:**
- **Strategy**: ComboStrength-based disposal prioritization
- **Order**: Weak → Medium → Strong → Critical (never dispose)
- **Focus**: Preserve valuable combinations while meeting 8-card requirement

**EXCEPTIONAL_TRUMP Mode:**
- **Trigger**: Very long trump (10+ cards) OR strong non-trump combinations
- **Strategy**: Strategic trump disposal using conservation hierarchy
- **Safety**: Uses trump-only disposal logic for optimal weak trump selection
- **Precision**: Guarantees disposal of weakest trump cards when forced

**Advanced Features:**
- **Trump-Aware Penalties** - Trump suits scored by conservation value rather than card count
- **Combo Protection** - Never eliminate suits containing pairs or tractors
- **Strategic Preservation** - Aces and Kings always protected in non-trump suits
- **Intelligent Trump Disposal** - Conservation hierarchy overrides pair preservation in trump-only scenarios
- **Consistent Trump Hierarchy** - All trump disposal decisions respect conservation values (3♠→4♠→5♠...)

### **Trump Declaration Strategy**

During progressive dealing, the AI uses sophisticated declaration logic:

**Strategic Capabilities:**
- **Hand Quality Focus** - Prioritizes suit length over high cards (7+ cards recommended)
- **Timing Optimization** - Peak declaration window at 40-70% of dealing
- **Override Intelligence** - Strategic decisions on when to override opponents
- **Team Coordination** - Consider teammate implications and positioning

---

## Strategic Disposal Hierarchy

When the AI cannot win a trick, it follows a sophisticated disposal system:

**Disposal Categories:**
- **Safe Cards** - No trump, no Ace, no points (7♣, 8♠, 9♦)
- **Good Cards** - Lose an Ace but no points given (A♣, Q♠, J♦)
- **Acceptable Cards** - Give away points but save trump (5♣, 10♠, K♦)
- **Forced Cards** - Trump cards only when no choice (3♦, 4♦)
