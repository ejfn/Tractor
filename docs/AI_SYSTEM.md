    Start([🧠 Memory Analysis]) --> Singles{Singles Logic<br/>Both copies ALL<br/>higher ranks played?}
    Singles -->|Yes| SingleWin[✅ Single Guaranteed<br/>K♥ wins if both A♥ played]
    Singles -->|No| Pairs{Pairs Logic<br/>ANY higher rank<br/>card played?}
    Pairs -->|Yes| PairWin[✅ Pair Guaranteed<br/>Q♥-Q♥ wins if ANY A♥ or K♥ played]
    Pairs -->|No| NotGuaranteed[❌ Not Guaranteed<br/>Use regular strategy]
    
    SingleWin --> Priority[🎯 STRATEGIC PRIORITY<br/>Point Collection First]
    PairWin --> Priority
    NotGuaranteed --> Regular[⚖️ Regular Strategy]
```

### **Guaranteed Winner Detection**

The AI identifies cards that are certain to win based on memory:

**Singles Logic**: K♥ wins if both A♥ copies have been played
**Pairs Logic**: Q♥-Q♥ wins if ANY A♥ or K♥ has been played

**Strategic Benefits:**
- **Point Collection Priority** - Play guaranteed point winners before opponents run out of suit
- **Optimal Timing** - Sequence plays based on remaining card knowledge

---

## Advanced Strategic Capabilities

### **Trump Management**

The AI uses sophisticated trump conservation with hierarchical values:

**Conservation Hierarchy:**
```
Big Joker (100) > Small Joker (90) > Trump Rank in Trump Suit (80) > 
Trump Rank in Off-Suits (70) > Trump Suit Cards (A♠:60 → 3♠:5)
```

**Strategic Principles:**
- **Hierarchical Preservation** - Play weakest trump when forced (3♠, 4♠)
- **Valuable Trump Protection** - Preserve trump rank cards and jokers
- **Memory-Enhanced Usage** - Track opponent trump depletion for optimal timing
- **Strategic Deployment** - Use trump exhaustion analysis for perfect timing

### **Kitty Swap Strategy**

The AI employs advanced suit elimination when managing the 8-card kitty:
```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Start([🎲 Kitty Analysis]) --> Suits[🔍 Analyze All Suits]
    Suits --> Scoring{Elimination Scoring<br/>Length + Value + Patterns}
    
    Scoring --> Short[+50: ≤3 cards<br/>Short Suit Bonus]
    Scoring --> Medium[+30: 4-5 cards<br/>Medium Suit Bonus]
    Scoring --> Penalties[-40: Aces<br/>-25: Kings<br/>-20: Pairs]
    
    Short --> Decision{Final Score<br/>> 20 + Length ≤ 6<br/>+ No Tractors?}
    Medium --> Decision
    Penalties --> Decision
    
    Decision -->|Yes| Eliminate[✅ ELIMINATE SUIT<br/>Complete Removal]
    Decision -->|No| Conservative[🛡️ CONSERVATIVE<br/>Keep Structure]
```

**Strategic Framework:**
- **Suit Elimination Priority** - Target 1-2 weak suits for complete removal
- **Value Preservation** - Always protect Aces, Kings, pairs, tractors
- **Trump Management** - Usually avoid trump unless exceptionally strong (10+ trumps)
- **Hand Structure Optimization** - Create voids for strategic advantage

### **Trump Declaration Strategy**

During progressive dealing, the AI uses sophisticated declaration logic:

**Strategic Capabilities:**
- **Hand Quality Focus** - Prioritizes suit length over high cards (7+ cards recommended)
- **Timing Optimization** - Peak declaration window at 40-70% of dealing
- **Override Intelligence** - Strategic decisions on when to override opponents
- **Team Coordination** - Consider teammate implications and positioning

---

## Strategic Disposal Hierarchy

When the AI cannot win a trick, it follows a sophisticated disposal system:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Start([Can't Win Trick<br/>Need to Dispose]) --> Q1{Have Safe Cards?<br/>7♣, 8♠, 9♦}
    Q1 -->|Yes| Best[✅ SAFEST<br/>Play Weakest Safe Card]
    Q1 -->|No| Q2{Have Non-Trump<br/>Non-Point Cards?<br/>A♣, Q♠, J♦}
    Q2 -->|Yes| Good[✅ GOOD<br/>Play Weakest Available]
    Q2 -->|No| Q3{Have ANY<br/>Non-Trump Cards?<br/>5♣, 10♠, K♦}
    Q3 -->|Yes| Okay[⚠️ ACCEPTABLE<br/>Play Weakest Non-Trump]
    Q3 -->|No| Last[❌ FORCED<br/>Play Weakest Trump]
```

**Disposal Categories:**
- **Safe Cards** - No trump, no Ace, no points (7♣, 8♠, 9♦)
- **Good Cards** - Lose an Ace but no points given (A♣, Q♠, J♦)
- **Acceptable Cards** - Give away points but save trump (5♣, 10♠, K♦)
- **Forced Cards** - Trump cards only when no choice (3♦, 4♦)
