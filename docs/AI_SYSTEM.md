# AI Strategic Intelligence System

This document details Tractor's 4-phase AI intelligence system that creates engaging and strategic gameplay through sophisticated decision-making algorithms.

## AI System Overview

The AI system operates in 4 distinct phases, each building upon the previous to create increasingly sophisticated gameplay:

- **Phase 1**: Basic combination detection and trump management
- **Phase 2**: Strategic context awareness and point-focused gameplay  
- **Phase 3**: Advanced memory systems and pattern recognition
- **Phase 4**: Advanced combination analysis and strategic optimization

## Phase 1: Foundation Intelligence

### Core Capabilities
- **Combination Detection**: Identifies singles, pairs, and tractors from hand
- **Trump Management**: Understands trump hierarchy and strength
- **Basic Strategy**: Follows suit requirements and plays valid combinations
- **Rule Compliance**: Ensures all moves follow game rules

### Technical Implementation
- Uses `createGameContext()` for basic game state analysis
- Implements simple heuristics for card selection
- Focuses on legal moves and basic game flow

## Phase 2: Strategic Context (Implemented)

### Enhanced Features
- **Point-Focused Strategy**: Prioritizes high-value cards (5s, 10s, Kings)
- **Positional Awareness**: Adapts strategy based on trick position
- **Team Dynamics**: Understands attacking vs defending team roles
- **Pressure Response**: Adjusts aggression based on point requirements

### Strategic Algorithms

#### Point Pressure System
```typescript
enum PointPressure {
  LOW = 'low',      // < 40% of points needed
  MEDIUM = 'medium', // 40-70% of points needed  
  HIGH = 'high'     // > 70% of points needed
}
```

#### Positional Strategy
- **Leading (First)**: Plays strong combinations to control trick
- **Following**: Balances point collection with combination matching
- **Late Position**: Focuses on point maximization or blocking

#### Play Style Adaptation
```typescript
enum PlayStyle {
  Conservative = 'conservative', // Preserve high cards
  Balanced = 'balanced',        // Mix of offense/defense
  Aggressive = 'aggressive',    // Force points aggressively
  Desperate = 'desperate'       // All-out point grabbing
}
```

### Implementation Details
- **Context Creation**: `src/ai/aiGameContext.ts` analyzes current game state
- **Strategy Selection**: `src/ai/aiPointFocusedStrategy.ts` implements point-driven decisions
- **Combo Analysis**: `src/ai/aiAdvancedCombinations.ts` evaluates combination strength
- **Decision Engine**: `src/ai/aiLogic.ts` coordinates all strategic components

## Phase 3: Memory & Pattern Recognition (Implemented)

### Advanced Capabilities
- **Card Memory**: Tracks played cards and infers remaining distributions
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies opponent tendencies and strategies
- **Adaptive Responses**: Adjusts strategy based on observed patterns
- **Endgame Optimization**: Sophisticated endgame planning

### Memory Systems
- **Played Card Tracking**: Maintains history of all played cards
- **Distribution Inference**: Estimates remaining cards in opponent hands

## Phase 4: Advanced Combination Analysis (Implemented)

### Strategic Optimization
- **Pattern-Based Selection**: Advanced combination pattern recognition and selection
- **Timing Optimization**: Strategic timing decisions (immediate, delayed, endgame)
- **Risk/Reward Analysis**: Sophisticated risk assessment with reward calculations
- **Multi-Dimensional Evaluation**: Considers effectiveness, timing, risk, and alternatives

### Advanced Features
- **Complex Combination Logic**: `src/ai/aiAdvancedCombinations.ts` implements sophisticated analysis
- **Strategic Pattern Recognition**: Identifies optimal combination patterns based on game context
- **Adaptive Strategy Selection**: Real-time strategy adjustment based on hand profile and position
- **Trump Combination Coordination**: Advanced trump tractor and pair timing optimization

### Technical Implementation
- **Combination Engine**: Advanced algorithms for combination evaluation and selection
- **Strategic Matrices**: Multi-dimensional analysis considering various strategic factors
- **Integration Framework**: Seamless integration with memory systems and context analysis
- **Performance Optimization**: Efficient algorithms maintaining real-time decision speeds

## AI Context System

### Game Context Creation
The `createGameContext()` function analyzes:
- Current team role (attacking/defending)
- Point collection status and requirements
- Remaining cards and game progression
- Trick position and strategic opportunities

### Context-Driven Decisions
All AI decisions are made through context analysis:
1. **Situation Assessment**: Analyze current game state
2. **Strategy Selection**: Choose appropriate play style
3. **Combination Evaluation**: Rank available plays
4. **Optimal Selection**: Execute best strategic choice

## Strategic Principles

### Point Management
- **High-Value Targeting**: Prioritize 5s, 10s, and Kings
- **Timing Optimization**: Play point cards when advantageous
- **Defensive Blocking**: Prevent opponents from collecting points
- **Endgame Planning**: Save critical cards for final tricks

### Combination Strategy
- **Leading Optimization**: Use strong combinations to control tricks
- **Following Efficiency**: Match combinations when beneficial
- **Tractor Preservation**: Save tractors for maximum impact
- **Single Card Timing**: Use singles strategically

### Team Coordination
- **Role Awareness**: Understand attacking vs defending responsibilities  
- **Point Distribution**: Coordinate point collection across team
- **Support Plays**: Make moves that benefit team strategy
- **Blocking Tactics**: Prevent opponent point collection

## Performance Characteristics

### Decision Speed
- **Real-time Analysis**: Context evaluation in ~100ms
- **Strategy Selection**: Play choice in ~200ms  
- **Smooth Gameplay**: Maintains natural game flow
