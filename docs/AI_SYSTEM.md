| 3 | **Point Maximization** | Best position to capture significant points |
| 4 | **Strategic Positioning** | Set up advantageous situation for final player |
| 5 | **Risk Assessment** | Balance aggressive play vs conservative preservation |

#### 3RD FOLLOWER STRATEGY (Position: FOURTH)

**Objective**: Final decision maker with complete information

| Priority | Strategy | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| 1 | **Complete Information** | All other plays visible, optimal decision possible |
| 2 | **Point Optimization** | Maximize points if winning, minimize if losing |
| 3 | **Trick Winner Consideration** | Take trick only if beneficial to team |
| 4 | **Conservative Cleanup** | Play minimal cards when trick is lost |
| 5 | **Endgame Planning** | Consider impact on remaining hand strength |


## Phase 1: Foundation Intelligence

### Core Capabilities
- **Combination Detection**: Identifies singles, pairs, and tractors from hand
- **Trump Management**: Understands trump hierarchy and strength
- **Basic Strategy**: Follows suit requirements and plays valid combinations
- **Rule Compliance**: Ensures all moves follow game rules

### Technical Implementation
- Uses `createGameContext()` for basic game state analysis
- Implements simple heuristics for card selection
- Focuses on legal moves and basic game flow

## Phase 2: Strategic Context (Implemented)

### Enhanced Features
- **Point-Focused Strategy**: Prioritizes high-value cards (5s, 10s, Kings)
- **Positional Awareness**: Adapts strategy based on trick position
- **Team Dynamics**: Understands attacking vs defending team roles
- **Pressure Response**: Adjusts aggression based on point requirements

### Strategic Algorithms

#### Point Pressure System
```typescript
enum PointPressure {
  LOW = 'low',      // < 40% of points needed
  MEDIUM = 'medium', // 40-70% of points needed  
  HIGH = 'high'     // > 70% of points needed
}
```

#### Positional Strategy
- **Leading (First)**: Plays strong combinations to control trick
- **Following**: Balances point collection with combination matching
- **Late Position**: Focuses on point maximization or blocking

#### Play Style Adaptation
```typescript
enum PlayStyle {
  Conservative = 'conservative', // Preserve high cards
  Balanced = 'balanced',        // Mix of offense/defense
  Aggressive = 'aggressive',    // Force points aggressively
  Desperate = 'desperate'       // All-out point grabbing
}
