# AI Decision Tree & Strategic Logic

> *Comprehensive decision trees mapping AI strategic logic for all player roles and game situations*

## Overview

The AI system uses sophisticated decision trees that adapt based on player role, game context, and strategic priorities. This document provides detailed flowcharts and logic trees for understanding how the AI makes strategic decisions in different scenarios.

## Core Decision Framework

## Implementation Notes

### Decision Tree Traversal

The AI system traverses these decision trees in real-time during gameplay:

1. **Context Analysis**: Determine game state, player role, and strategic priorities
2. **Tree Selection**: Choose appropriate decision tree based on role and situation
3. **Branch Navigation**: Follow decision branches based on analyzed conditions
4. **Strategy Refinement**: Apply position-specific and memory-enhanced modifications
5. **Move Execution**: Convert strategic decision into specific card play

### Performance Considerations

- **Real-time Processing**: All decision trees execute within 100-200ms for responsive gameplay
- **Memory Integration**: Card tracking and pattern recognition enhance decision quality without performance impact
- **Adaptive Complexity**: Decision tree depth adapts based on game importance and available processing time
- **Fallback Systems**: Multiple fallback strategies ensure robust decision-making under all conditions

### Strategic Evolution

The decision trees represent the current implementation and will evolve as the AI system advances:

- **Phase 4+ Enhancements**: Advanced pattern recognition and opponent modeling
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Decision trees may incorporate learned strategic patterns
- **Meta-Strategy Adaptation**: Long-term strategic adaptation based on gameplay outcomes
- **Difficulty Scaling**: Decision tree complexity can be adjusted for different skill levels
