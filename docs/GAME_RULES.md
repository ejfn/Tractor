# Game Rules & How to Play

This guide provides comprehensive rules and gameplay instructions for Tractor (升级), also known as Shengji.

## Game Objective

Work with your AI teammate to collect points (5s, 10s, Kings) and advance through card ranks. The first team to reach Ace wins!

## Team Setup

- **Team A**: You + Bot 2
- **Team B**: Bot 1 + Bot 3
- **Play Order**: Counter-clockwise (Human → Bot 1 → Bot 2 → Bot 3)

## Basic Rules

### 1. Trump Declaration
- Declare trump suit by playing pairs during dealing phase
- Higher pairs override lower pairs for trump selection
- Big/Small Joker pairs can declare "no trump" rounds

### 2. Trick Play
- Follow suit when possible (must play same suit if you have it)
- Highest card wins trick unless trumped
- Trick winner leads next trick
- Must match combination type when following (singles, pairs, tractors)

### 3. Point Collection
- **5s**: 5 points each
- **10s and Kings**: 10 points each
- **Other cards**: 0 points
- Team collects points from tricks they win

### 4. Round Advancement
- **Attacking team** (starts with lower rank) needs 80+ points to advance
- **Defending team** (starts with higher rank) tries to prevent this
- Successful teams advance 1-3 ranks based on performance
- Teams alternate between attacking and defending roles

## Card Hierarchy

Cards are ranked from highest to lowest trump strength:

### Trump Cards (Beat all non-trump)
1. **Big Joker** (🃏) - Highest trump card
2. **Small Joker** (🃏) - Second highest trump
3. **Trump rank** (e.g., 2♠ when Spades trump, rank 2)
4. **Off-suit rank** (e.g., 2♥, 2♣, 2♦ when Spades trump)
   - *Equal strength - first played wins*
5. **Trump suit** (A, K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3 of trump suit)

### Non-Trump Cards
- Ranked by suit within each suit: A, K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3
- Cannot beat trump cards
- Higher suit cards beat lower suit cards of same suit

## Strategic Tips

### General Strategy
- **Point Management**: Focus on collecting 5s, 10s, and Kings
- **Trump Conservation**: Save trump cards for critical moments
- **Combination Building**: Build pairs and tractors for stronger plays
- **Team Coordination**: Work with your AI teammate

### Positional Play
- **Leading**: Control the trick direction, probe for information
- **Following**: Balance point collection with combination requirements
- **Late Position**: Maximize point collection or block opponents

### Trump Usage
- **Timing**: Use trumps strategically, not wastefully
- **Conservation**: Save high trumps for important tricks
- **Blocking**: Use trumps to prevent opponent point collection
- **Coordination**: Work with teammate for optimal trump usage

## Common Mistakes

### Card Play Errors
- **Suit Following**: Forgetting to follow suit when possible
- **Combination Matching**: Not matching the led combination type
- **Trump Waste**: Using high trumps unnecessarily
- **Point Timing**: Playing point cards at wrong moments

### Strategic Errors
- **Poor Trump Declaration**: Declaring trump without strong holdings
- **Isolation**: Not coordinating with teammate
- **Point Neglect**: Focusing only on winning tricks, ignoring points
- **Endgame Planning**: Not saving critical cards for final tricks

## Advanced Concepts

### Trump Suit Rotation
When trump is declared, the suit order rotates to maintain black-red alternation:
- **No Trump**: ♠ ♥ ♣ ♦
- **Hearts Trump**: ♥ ♣ ♦ ♠
- **Clubs Trump**: ♣ ♦ ♠ ♥
- **Diamonds Trump**: ♦ ♠ ♥ ♣
- **Spades Trump**: ♠ ♥ ♣ ♦

### Equal Strength Rules
- When trump rank cards in different suits have equal strength
- **Rule**: First played wins among equal strength cards
- **Example**: If 2♥ and 2♣ are both played (when Spades trump, rank 2), whichever was played first wins

### Combination Hierarchy
- **Trump combinations** always beat **non-trump combinations** of same type
- **Higher combinations** (tractors) beat **lower combinations** (pairs) beat **singles**
- **Within same type**: Higher cards beat lower cards
- **Following**: Must play same combination type if possible
