- **Isolation**: Not coordinating with teammate
- **Point Neglect**: Focusing only on winning tricks, ignoring points
- **Endgame Planning**: Not saving critical cards for final tricks

## Advanced Concepts

### Trump Suit Rotation
When trump is declared, the suit order rotates to maintain black-red alternation:
- **No Trump**: ‚ô† ‚ô• ‚ô£ ‚ô¶
- **Hearts Trump**: ‚ô• ‚ô£ ‚ô¶ ‚ô†
- **Clubs Trump**: ‚ô£ ‚ô¶ ‚ô† ‚ô•
- **Diamonds Trump**: ‚ô¶ ‚ô† ‚ô• ‚ô£
- **Spades Trump**: ‚ô† ‚ô• ‚ô£ ‚ô¶

### Equal Strength Rules
- When trump rank cards in different suits have equal strength
- **Rule**: First played wins among equal strength cards
- **Example**: If 2‚ô• and 2‚ô£ are both played (when Spades trump, rank 2), whichever was played first wins

### Combination Hierarchy
- **Trump combinations** always beat **non-trump combinations** of same type
- **Higher combinations** (tractors) beat **lower combinations** (pairs) beat **singles**
- **Within same type**: Higher cards beat lower cards
- **Following**: Must play same combination type if possible
