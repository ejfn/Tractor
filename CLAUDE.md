## Project Overview

Tractor is a React Native Expo app that implements a single-player version of the Chinese card game Shengji (ÂçáÁ∫ß), also known as Tractor. It's a trick-taking card game where players work in teams to advance through card ranks from 2 to Ace. The game uses concepts like trumps, combinations of cards, and strategic play.

- `/app/` - Expo Router app routing

## Core Game Architecture

The game implements the following key concepts:

1. **Game State Management**
   - The game state is managed through custom hooks in `/src/hooks/`:
     - `useGameState.ts`: Core game state management and actions
     - `useAITurns.ts`: AI player turn handling and thinking indicators
     - `useTrickResults.ts`: Trick completion result display
     - `useAnimations.ts`: Card animations and transitions
   - The `GameState` type defines the complete state of the game
   - State transitions properly preserve the winning player when a trick completes

2. **Card Mechanics**
   - Cards have suits, ranks, and jokers
   - Cards have point values (5s = 5 points, 10s and Ks = 10 points)
   - Trump cards are determined by a trump rank and optionally a trump suit
   - Trump cards follow a hierarchy: Big Jokers > Small Jokers > Trump rank in trump suit > Trump rank in other suits > Trump suit cards

3. **Combo Types and Rules**
   - Singles: Any card can be played as a single
   - Pairs: Two identical cards (same rank AND same suit), including joker pairs (SJ-SJ, BJ-BJ)
   - Tractors: Consecutive pairs of the same suit (e.g., 7‚ô•-7‚ô•-8‚ô•-8‚ô•)
   - Special rules:
     - Cards of same rank but different suits do NOT form pairs or tractors
     - Trump cards of different levels don't form tractors with each other
     - SJ-SJ-BJ-BJ forms a special tractor (the most powerful combo)
     - Any trump combo beats any non-trump combo of the same type and length
     - When following suit:
       - If player has enough cards of the leading suit, they must play a valid combo of the same type in that suit
       - If player has some cards of leading suit but not enough to form a valid combo, must use all those cards
       - If player has no cards of leading suit, can play any cards of the correct length (combo type not enforced)

4. **Game Flow**
   - Phases: dealing, declaring, playing, scoring, gameOver
   - Players take turns playing cards following specific combination rules
   - Teams (A and B) alternate between defending and attacking

5. **AI Logic**
   - AI players use advanced strategy logic (no difficulty settings)
   - AI makes strategic decisions about card play and trump declaration
   - AI analyzes trick points, partner position, and remaining cards

## Development Notes

- The project uses TypeScript with strict type checking
- UI is built with React Native components
- Animations use React Native's Animated API
- The project follows Expo's recommended structure and configuration
- Optimized for mobile platforms (especially Android)
- Web platform support is disabled for better performance focus

## Quality Checks

Before committing changes, always run:

```bash
# Check for linting issues
npm run lint

# Check for type errors
npm run typecheck
```

Ensure that you:

- Always do type checking
- Always do linting
- Always run all tests before committing

Ensure that you address all errors before committing. You may see linting warnings, but they should not be increased from baseline. For tests, run:

```bash
# Run tests
npm test
```

## Implementation Philosophy

- All safety timers have been removed in favor of more robust error handling
- The system uses a fail-fast approach for invalid states rather than silent recovery
- Game timing constants are centralized in `gameTimings.ts` for consistent pacing:
  - AI_MOVE_DELAY = 800ms (thinking animation duration)
  - MOVE_COMPLETION_DELAY = 1200ms (time to see cards after play)
  - CARD_ANIMATION_FALLBACK = 1000ms (maximum time to wait for card animations)
  - ANIMATION_COMPLETION_DELAY = 200ms (delay after animations complete before callback)
  - TRICK_RESULT_DISPLAY_TIME = 2000ms (time to show trick results)
- State transitions are synchronized to ensure visual consistency
- The useAITurns hook handles all AI players with a consistent approach (no special case handling)
- Error handling is more explicit to aid debugging
- Special case fixes are avoided; general solutions are preferred that work for all players

## Trick Completion & Results Flow

The game follows a specific sequence when completing tricks to ensure the user experience is smooth:

1. **Trick Completion Sequence**:
   - When all 4 players have played cards, the trick is considered complete
   - The winner is determined based on card comparison rules
   - The winning player index is stored in `gameState.winningPlayerIndex` for later use
   - The completed trick is stored in `lastCompletedTrick` for display
   - The trick result (winner name + points) is shown in the top-right corner

2. **Display Timing**:
   - All 4 players' cards MUST remain visible on the table when the result is shown
   - The trick result notification displays for 2 seconds
   - After the notification is hidden, the cards are cleared from the table
   - The game then proceeds to the next trick with the winning player starting

3. **Implementation Details**:
   - Cards should NEVER disappear before the trick result is shown
   - The completed trick with all 4 players' cards must be displayed during the result display
   - Sequence must be followed: (1) show trick result (2) hide result (3) clear cards
   - State transitions are synchronized to ensure consistent visual experience
   - `handleTrickResultComplete` clears the current trick and sets the winner as the next player
   - Player transitions are properly handled to maintain gameplay flow

4. **Component Responsibilities**:
   - `useGameState`: Manages core game state including player transitions after tricks
   - `useTrickResults`: Manages the timing of result display and clearing
   - `useAITurns`: Handles AI player decisions in correct sequence
   - `CardPlayArea`: Handles the display of cards on the table (respects lastCompletedTrick)
   - `TrickResultDisplay`: Shows the winner notification in the top-right
   - `GameScreenController`: Coordinates all components through the trick completion

5. **Testing**:
   - The trick completion flow has unit tests in `__tests__/trickCompletion.test.ts`
   - Tests verify that cards remain visible until after the result is shown
   - Tests ensure proper cleanup happens after the result is hidden
   - Synchronized state transitions handle reliable game flow

## UI Implementation Details

### Card Rendering

- Human player cards: 65x95px size, displayed at the bottom of the screen
- AI player cards: 40x60px size (reduced from 50x75px), displayed around the table (top, left, right)
- Cards use a simplified 3x3 grid pattern for card backs with a centered "T" emblem
- Each AI player shows up to 10 stacked cards
- Jokers have no border and use smaller "JOKER" text
- Popup card in the play area has standard size with white border

### Player Layout

- **Top Player (Bot 2)**:
  - Cards displayed horizontally, stacked left to right with -30px overlap
  - Cards rotated 180¬∞ to face downward toward the center
  - Shown with a small label "Bot 2" and card count

- **Left Player (Bot 1)**:
  - Cards displayed vertically, stacked top to bottom with -48px overlap
  - Cards rotated 90¬∞ to face right/center
  - Shown with a small label "Bot 1" and card count

- **Right Player (Bot 3)**:
  - Cards displayed vertically, stacked bottom to top with -48px overlap
  - Cards rotated 270¬∞ to face left/center
  - Shown with a small label "Bot 3" and card count

- **Human Player**:
  - No label (obvious from position at the bottom)
  - Cards with -40px overlap for compact display
  - Selected cards rise by 10px with no z-index change

### Team Status Display

- Displayed in the top corners of the play area
- **Defending Team (Team A)**: Left corner with shield icon (üõ°Ô∏è)
- **Attacking Team (Team B)**: Right corner with sword icon (‚öîÔ∏è)
- Both have consistent height with point display for attacking team

### Play Area Layout

- Cards are positioned in four regions, one for each player:
  - Top: Cards played by the top player
  - Left: Cards played by the left player
  - Right: Cards played by the right player
  - Bottom: Cards played by the human player
- Trump/kitty card in center with reduced opacity

### Animation Implementation

- Card movement animations use React Native's Animated API with spring physics
- Animations include position, rotation, scale bounce, and fade
- Played cards animate from player's hand to their respective area on the table
- Animation uses enhanced parameters for natural motion:
  - friction: 8.5
  - tension: 50
  - velocity: 3

### Performance Optimizations

- Rendering optimizations with React Native flags:
  - backfaceVisibility: 'hidden'
  - shouldRasterizeIOS: true
  - renderToHardwareTextureAndroid: true
- Minimal shadow effects for better performance
- Careful management of z-index for proper stacking with globalPlayOrder for cards
- Proper card positioning and sequencing in CardPlayArea for consistent rendering
- Web platform support disabled to focus on mobile performance
- Removing web-specific styling code for cleaner implementation
- Single AI strategy implementation (no difficulty switching) for simplicity
- Centralized timing constants for predictable animations and game pacing
- Fail-fast approach to error handling for easier debugging
- Synchronized state transitions for visual consistency
- Avoidance of special case handling for specific AI players
- Consistent player transition handling for all players
- Proper trick completion flow with clear state transitions

### Card Suit Ordering Logic

The game uses a rotated suit ordering system that maintains an alternating black-red pattern while prioritizing the trump suit:

1. The base suit order is: Spades ‚ô† (black), Hearts ‚ô• (red), Clubs ‚ô£ (black), Diamonds ‚ô¶ (red)

2. When a suit is declared as trump, the ordering rotates to put the trump suit first while maintaining the alternating color pattern:
   - No trump declared: Spades, Hearts, Clubs, Diamonds
   - Clubs is trump: Clubs, Diamonds, Spades, Hearts
   - Diamonds is trump: Diamonds, Spades, Hearts, Clubs
   - Hearts is trump: Hearts, Clubs, Diamonds, Spades
   - Spades is trump: Spades, Hearts, Clubs, Diamonds

3. The implementation in `PlayerHandAnimated.tsx` rotates the standard suit order by:
   - Finding the index of the trump suit in the standard order
   - Slicing the array to place the trump suit and all suits after it at the beginning
   - Followed by all suits that came before the trump suit in the standard ordering

4. This rotation applies to both:
   - Main suit group ordering (lines 82-109)
   - Ordering within the trump rank cards (lines 62-88)

This approach ensures the player's hand is organized with:

1. Jokers first (Big, then Small)
2. Trump cards next (trump rank cards, then trump suit cards)
3. Remaining suits in rotated order to maintain alternating black-red pattern

## Implementation Notes

- When comparing two combos, always throw an error when different lengths occur
- In `gamePlayManager.ts`, trick completion requires all non-leading players to have played
- Trick plays array should contain exactly (players.length - 1) plays when complete
- Leading player's cards are stored in trick.leadingCombo, not in the plays array
- The CardPlayArea component handles both current tricks and display of completed tricks
- In useAITurns, avoid special case handling for different AI players
- Use the winningPlayerIndex in GameState to properly track the winner between trick completion and result display
- Prefer general solutions that work for all players rather than special case fixes
- Always block AI moves during trick result display to prevent incorrect state transitions
- Follow the proper sequence for trick completion: play ‚Üí show result ‚Üí clear ‚Üí trick winner as next player
- When creating git branches, use the format `{user}/{feature-name}` (e.g., `ejfn/enhance-round-complete-modal`)
