## What is Tractor?

**Tractor** (ÂçáÁ∫ß/Shengji) is a challenging Chinese trick-taking card game where strategy and teamwork are essential. You partner with an AI teammate to collect points and advance through card ranks from 2 to Ace.

**Core Gameplay:**

- **Team-based**: You + Bot 2 vs Bot 1 + Bot 3 in strategic cooperation
- **Rank Progression**: Start at rank 2, advance through ranks by collecting 80+ points per round
- **Trump Declaration**: Players can declare trump during progressive dealing using pairs or jokers
- **Card Combinations**: Play singles, pairs, or tractors (consecutive pairs) with complex following rules
- **Victory Condition**: First team to advance to Ace rank wins the game

**Unique Features:**

- **Progressive Dealing**: Cards dealt one-by-one with real-time trump declaration opportunities
- **Kitty Management**: Winner receives 8 hidden cards that can provide massive endgame bonuses
- **Complex Trump Hierarchy**: Big Joker > Small Joker > Trump rank cards > Trump suit cards
