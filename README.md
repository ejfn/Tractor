## What is Tractor?

**Tractor** is a classic Chinese card game where you work with an AI teammate to collect points and advance through card ranks. The first team to reach Ace wins!

- **Teams**: You + Bot 2 vs Bot 1 + Bot 3  
- **Trump System**: Declare trump by playing pairs during dealing
- **Combinations**: Singles, pairs, and tractors (consecutive pairs)
- **Points**: 5s (5pts), 10s and Kings (10pts)
- **Objective**: Collect enough points to advance through card ranks

*For complete rules and strategy guide, see **[Game Rules](docs/GAME_RULES.md)***

## Key Features

- **4-Phase AI Intelligence** with sophisticated strategic decision-making
- **Smooth card animations** with React Native Reanimated
- **Smart card auto-selection** for pairs and tractors
- **Touch-optimized UI** with team color coding
- **Comprehensive testing** with 427 tests across 60 test suites

## Technology

Built with **React Native + Expo** for mobile platforms:
- **React Native 0.76+** - Cross-platform mobile development
- **Expo SDK 52** - Development tools and native API access
- **TypeScript 5.7+** - Type safety and developer experience
- **Jest** - Testing framework with React Testing Library
- **ESLint** - Code linting with React Native specific rules
- **React Native Reanimated** - High-performance animations

*Mobile-only support for Android and iOS. Currently tested on Android only.*

## AI Intelligence

Sophisticated **4-phase AI system** with restructured priority chain, real-time trick analysis, enhanced opponent blocking, strategic point card management, and intelligent trump conservation.

**Latest Enhancements:**
- **Strategic Point Management**: AI avoids wasting point cards when opponent is winning
- **Trump Hierarchy Conservation**: Proper selection of weak trump cards over valuable ones
- **Enhanced Opponent Blocking**: Sophisticated response based on trick value and card conservation
